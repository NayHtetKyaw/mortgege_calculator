Mortage formula 
---------------

Mortgege = P * i((1+i)^n) / ((1+i)^n)-1

P = principal (the amount of the loan)
i = annual rate of interest 
n = total number of months to repay loan

annual rate of interest has to divided by 100 since it is a percentage, 
and then divided by 12 for each year (i/100)/12

number of months has to be multiply by 12(months for 1 year). 
n = total_number_of_years_to_repay * 12
